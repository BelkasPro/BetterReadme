## üìú Hello user, in this Repository i show you how to create really good ReadMe to your Profile or project.
Well first let's deal with the repository, first we have to create the repository itself and to do that we just need to click on the `Repository` button and then `New` below you can see how it looks like.

After doing this you can see this page, here you need set `checked` 1 setting. First make a repository name and then you can add a description to this repository, below we should put `checked` next to `Add a README file` after that you can create it.
